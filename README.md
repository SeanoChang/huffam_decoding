# Huffman Decoding Program

Welcome to the Huffman Decoding program project! This C program is designed to decode binary files that have been encoded using the Huffman coding algorithm. The program utilizes stacks, linked lists, and binary trees to efficiently decode the encoded data.

## Features

- **Huffman Decoding**: The program decodes binary files that have been encoded using the Huffman coding technique.

- **Data Structures**: The program leverages stacks, linked lists, and binary trees to manage and decode the encoded data.

- **Efficient Decoding**: The use of appropriate data structures ensures efficient decoding of the encoded binary files.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SeanoChang/huffam_decoding.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd huffam_decoding
   ```

3. **Compile and Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program:

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

5. **Output**:
   - The `outputs/*.htree` files contain the reconstructed Huffman Tree
   - The `outputs/*.ori` files contain the decoded ASCII text.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Encoded Files**: Prepare binary files that have been encoded using the Huffman coding algorithm.

2. **Run the Program**: Use the compiled program to decode the encoded files and obtain the original data.
